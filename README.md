To get the program to work, put the CalculationsUsingTXTfile.py and nameAndMarks.txt file into a folder
If you do not do this the program wont work, since the .py files relies on reading the txt file
I developed my python skills greatly over the creation of this program
Finishing this program made me feel great, because I created a working program.
